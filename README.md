# NukeOut!
- Was Supposed To Be My Entry For Game Off Jam.

- Is Now Just A Game Iâ€˜m Making.

- Is A Krakout Clone (Yes, [that one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakout). It's clones all the way down!).

- Still Has An ðŸ’¥ Twist!

## Technical Details

Written in C++. Made with the SFML framework.

## Mechanical Details

There are three components: the Krakout clone, a text adventure, and a Space Invaders type game. The Nuke is the catalyst that moves the player from one type of game to another.
